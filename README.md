# German Credit Risk Prediction
This project evaluates different machine learning models to classify individuals as good or bad credit risks based on financial and personal attributes. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Statlog German Credit Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/144/statlog+german+credit+data).

## Objective
The main goal is to compare the performance of traditional machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) with a Neural Network model (NN) in predicting credit risk.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 1,000 samples with 20 features, representing financial history, personal information, and loan-related attributes. The target variable:

- 1 (Good Credit Risk)
- 2 (Bad Credit Risk)

## Models Compared
- Neural Network (NN)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Performance Evaluation
The models are evaluated using:
✅ Accuracy
✅ Precision, Recall, and F1-score
